    "Description": "An interesting example of Chinese written in Arabic script. The subject matter is quotations from Mao's \"Little Red Book\", these are most likely notes to help the writer (an Imam) remember these quotations. Please note that this text, while preserving the word internal structural logic of Arabic script, is actually written left to write and includes certain Chinese characters. This shows the increase in influence of education and language modernization reforms during this era. ",

Similarly in the Iranain diplomatic corps, Oveicy published this work in the French language while working in the Ottoman court in Istanbul. His proposal is highly divergent and represents what is basically a new script and new graphemes, but with the underlying logic of the Latin script (direction, word formation) ",

    "Description": "Uzbek originally used Perso-Arabic, then Latin, then Cyrillic, and upon independence from the USSR a new Latin orthography. However, despite the official new latin orthography, most people still publish and write in cyrillic script. This demonstrates that once a population reaches literacy in a script--changing this becomes difficult in practice. This is different from earlier shifts where modernity/literacy/reform were tied so closely with script functionality. Please note the \"oriental\" typeface that calls back to the original Arabic script of the language. ",

    "Description": "The Musalman is the oldest Urdu-language daily newspaper published from Chennai in India all of which are handwritten by calligraphers, before being mass-produced with a printing press. This is due to only the recent advent of proper Nastaliq representation in digital typesetting, and still the lack of flexibility compared to physical writing. The stickiness of Nastaliq for Urdu (compared to Farsi) is due to the orthography of Urdu relying in Nastaliq calligraphic variations for grapheme differentiation--to a much larger and more standardized extent than Persian.

Nastaliq is heavily identified with Persian and Urdu while Naskh is heavily associated with Arabic and Pashto. In texts where there is a mixture of these languages, the difference in style is used to easily identify the difference language--avoiding confusion and easing parsing. ",
