P2: Visual Collection
Due Week 10, Apr 3

In this project, you will create a visual collection of related items, considering how they are categorized, described, and contextualized in a digital space. Your collection can focus on anything, but should be structured with intentional metadata and organizational logic. It may be as practical or impractical as youâ€™d like. It may be esoteric, speculative, historical, or personal. What matters is that you have a clear justification for your method.

The goal is to think critically about curation, classification, and the relationships between different elements. How do digital collections shape meaning? What does metadata reveal or obscure? Additionally, this is an opportunity to put your JavaScript learnings into practice.
Assignment Goals
Curate a collection of at least 10-15 items with categories and metadata.
Explore how classification systems impact interpretation.
Structure the collection using JSON for data organization.
Build a simple front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the collection.
Provide an index and filtering interface (search is optional).
Deliverables
Final Visual Collection: A front-end interface with a collection of at least 10-15 items, including categories and other metadata, that can be viewed and filtered in different ways.
Reflection Paper (500+ words): Think about: Why this collection? How did you make decisions regarding what to include and what not to include? How does structuring and classifying the collection affect interpretation? How did you make your design decisions and how do these affect the process of navigation and discovery? How does the inclusion of JavaScript affect the digital experience?

I want to present a collection of visual examples of how the orthographies and scripts of languages in the Soviet East and neighboring regions were effected by top down drives for Socialism, Nationalism, and Modernization. 

Examples will include the effects of printing technology, script reform, language standrdization, and political realpolitik concerns. 

The project will have two components, once section being organized like a museum exhibit, with substantive explainations organized into a narrarative order of exemplry pieces in lieu of a simple textual explainantion
The main component will be a catalogue of examples of Socialist Realism and Modernism, applied to the orthogrpahies and standardization of languages of the "Soviet East" 
I am planning on slowly adding to this over time, including examples I will aquire this summer in Tajikistan 

Name of website: Basmadzhestvo, play on words between "Basmaci" Turkish for printer/typogrpaher and "Basmachi" a Central Asian rebel and the Russian -estvo suffix creating abstract nouns. Similar sounding words, diffferent etymplogies
