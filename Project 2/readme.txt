P2: Visual Collection
Due Week 10, Apr 3

I want to present a collection of visual examples of how the orthographies and scripts of languages in the Soviet East/Islamic World and neighboring regions were effected by top down drives for Socialism, Nationalism, and Modernization. 

Examples will include the effects of printing technology, script reform, language standrdization, and political realpolitik concerns. 

The project will have two components, once section being organized like a museum exhibit, with substantive explainations organized into a narrarative order of exemplry pieces in lieu of a simple textual explainantion

The main component will be a catalogue of examples of Socialist Realism and Modernism, applied to the orthogrpahies and standardization of languages of the "Soviet East" 
I am planning on slowly adding to this over time, including examples I will aquire this summer in Tajikistan 

As of now it is just examples displaying the main concepts and trends I have found. 

Name of website: Basmadzhestvo, play on words between "Basmaci" Turkish for printer/typogrpaher and "Basmachi" a Central Asian rebel and the Russian -estvo suffix creating abstract nouns. Similar sounding words, diffferent etymplogies
