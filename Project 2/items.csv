[小儿经毛主席语录],Chinese ,Perso-Arabic,Xiao'er Jing Orthography ,unorthodox script direction ,~1966,China,何德江 阿訇,Chinese,"An interesting example of Chinese written in Arabic script. The subject matter is quotations from Mao's ""Little Red Book"", these are most likely notes to help the writer (an Imam) remember these quotations. Please note that this text, while preserving the word internal structural logic of Arabic script, is actually written left to write and includes certain Chinese characters. This shows the increase in influence of education and language modernization reforms during this era. ",
نمونه ای از اصلاحات املایی,Persian,Modified Perso Arabic,"Modified Perso-Arabic Script, ","isolated forms, typewriter technology",~1876,United Kingdom,میرزا ملکم خان,Iranian,"The author, ethnically Armenian, was the Iranian ambassador to many European countries at the time. His proposal of script reform was to simply reduce the Perso-Arabic script to singular nonvariant forms, aligning with the Latin script and--importantly--typewriting technology. ",
Alphabet de la nouvelle ecriture. Projet de réforme alphabétique due monde Musulman basé sur l’histoire générale des alphabets de l’univers,Persian,Novel,"Novel Script, replacement for Perso -Arabic","isolated forms, novel graphemes, typewriter technology",1913,Ottoman Empire,"Oveicy, Ali Mohamded Khan [Ali Muhammad Khan Uvaysi]",Iranian,"The author was actually influenced by Mirza Malkam Khan's earlier work. Similarly in the Iranain diplomatic corps, Oveicy published this work in the French language while working in the Ottoman court in Istanbul. His proposal is highly divergent and represents what is basically a new script and new graphemes, but with the underlying logic of the Latin script (direction, word formation) ",
رسم الخط,"Persian, Arabic, Pashto",Novel,"Novel Script, replacement for Perso -Arabic","isolated forms, static forms, connected, novel graphemes, typewriter technology",1953,Afghanistan,محمد اکبر خان یوسفی,Afghani,"This proposed reformed script consists of novel graphemes, but attempts to reserve the logic of having letters connect word internally, just without distinct forms based on positionality like in Perso-Arabic. This is an attempt to transfer the connection of letters in Latin cursive as an ersatz equivalent to the way letters connect in Persian/Arabic. ",
الخط العربي وآفاق تطوره,Arabic,Novel,"Novel Script, replacement for Perso -Arabic","isolated forms, novel graphemes, typewriter technology",1952,Algeria,خالد ڨطيش,Algerian,"This proposal consists of novel graphemes, and is extremely open about typewriter and future technological compatibility of the Arabic script. It preserves the right left directionality of the arabic script. ",
[Яңа имлә мисалы],Tatar,Modified Perso Arabic,"Modified Perso-Arabic Script, ","isolated forms, typewriter technology",1924,USSR,A. Aziz ,Tatar,"This script/typeface was fully implemented in the USSR for languages using the Perso-Arabic script, but saw its most heavy implementation in Tatarstan. The reduction of each arabic letter to a singular isolated form was done for compatibility with typewriters. ",
Butun Dunya Inqilabe Bulyr ,Tatar ,"Modified Perso Arabic, Latin","Modified Perso-Arabic Script, ","isolated forms, typewriter technology, latin orthography",1927,USSR,STATE PUBLICATION,Tatar,"Even in non print / typewriter scenarios Yana-imla tatar script was implemented, as seen in the text in the poster in the back. Please also note the later official Latin Tatar alphabet in parallel. ",
Shohnoma,Uzbek,Cyrillic,Oriental Typeface ,Cyrillic,1993,Uzbekistan,Firdawsi,Uzbek,"Uzbek originally used Perso-Arabic, then Latin, then Cyrillic, and upon independence from the USSR a new Latin orthography. However, despite the official new latin orthography, most people still publish and write in cyrillic script. This demonstrates that once a population reaches literacy in a script--changing this becomes difficult in practice. This is different from earlier shifts where modernity/literacy/reform were tied so closely with script functionality. Please note the ""oriental"" typeface that calls back to the original Arabic script of the language. ",
مسلمان,Urdu,Perso-Arabic,Nastaliq ,Lithogrpahy,Current,India,N/A,Indian,"The Musalman is the oldest Urdu-language daily newspaper published from Chennai in India all of which are handwritten by calligraphers, before being mass-produced with a printing press. This is due to only the recent advent of proper Nastaliq representation in digital typesetting, and still the lack of flexibility compared to physical writing. The stickiness of Nastaliq for Urdu (compared to Farsi) is due to the orthography of Urdu relying in Nastaliq calligraphic variations for grapheme differentiation--to a much larger and more standardized extent than Persian. ",
معلم پښتو,Persian / Pahto,Perso-Arabic,Nastaliq (Persian) Naskh (Pashto),"calligraphic variation, ",1935,Afghanistan,N/A,Afghani,"The variation between Naskh and Nastaliq in the Persianate world is not just based on style or aesthetics. Nastaliq is heavily identified with Persian and Urdu while Naskh is heavily associated with Arabic and Pashto. In texts where there is a mixture of these languages, the difference in style is used to easily identify the difference language--avoiding confusion and easing parsing. ",
